This simple app is a mesh-up of 2 services:
- Setgetgo random English word
- Spotify API

It fetches a random word and then looks for an album containing that word on Spotify, if found it displays it in a carousel. Image are interactive and using Spotify URI so you can actually play the album. Pretty nice isn't it?
